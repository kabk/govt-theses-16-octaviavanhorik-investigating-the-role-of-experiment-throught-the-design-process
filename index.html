<b>investigating the role of experiment trought the process of creation</b>

The process of creation is for me the most exciting area of Graphic Design and, therefore, the most evident subject that I would like to approach during my final project. Within the big scope of what ‘process of creation’ includes, I would like to focus particularly on experiment and experimental approach in graphic design field. At the Academy, students have at least once experimented. We often hear during  presentation ‘I was just experimenting’ to explain a design choice. I can’t remember when I start experimenting! Was it before the Academy? Or maybe it started with this class where the only advice from the teacher was ‘go and experiment’. Loved it. I wouldn’t know how or where to start, but I would just do something, see what happen; do something else, see what happen… and the process goes on and on. I believe there is no ‘righter’ or ‘wronger’ approach while creating a design. Although when I don’t experiment during the process, I feel that I have missed the chance to do something different. It doesn’t really matter what can possibly happen during the process — and that might be explaining the reason why I have such an attraction for experiment in general. The fact is, when you experiment, you don’t expect — as well my fascination might come from the surprises and discoveries. Experimenting means being curious, believing you can make something that doesn’t already exist. If I mix element 72 to element 150, can it be outstanding? can it be insignificant? I find myself more experimenting and trying things out not really knowing what the outcome will be… Like this thesis actually! This might actually seem ironic, but since this thesis and its process has been started, the whole ‘thing’ feels already like an experiment to me. ‘Thesis_V13’ has just been created and I am still puzzling around wondering which is the best way to approach the subject. Is there a proper way? To be totally honest, I am not sure what to do, how and where I should start. I want to talk about everything and nothing at the same time. I want to tackle every single experiment knowing that I will lose myself in this spread-out process, but I guess I will figure out along the way and puzzle through this journey. 


The following thesis aims to investigate the role of experiment through the design process. How designers are able to experiment when the framework of process of creation is narrowing down? How does a designer find the freedom of experimenting when restriction and agreement are the main concern? How to challenge innovation? fundamental notions of function? and aesthetics? 
I strongly believe that there is much more to explore before embarking into the real field. What are the essentials features which could lead me to great experiment? What can I learn from this experiment?
